### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Alexander aka Folkskrik

I am a software developer. Pushed to learn new abilities and realize my full potential possibility for developing software and many more. I always have been interested in Programming and IT technology.
I enjoy spending time with friends and family in my free time. And I use my free time for gaming, traveling, and learning new things, and the best out of my free time I get when I combine everything.
